The testing was performed on the V3C HTML validator by direct input before deploying to the Gitpages. The image below shows all the bugs found.


![html testing img](assets/images/readme-images/html-testing-1.jpg)

1. The error on position 1 was fixed by removing the button from the anchor tag.
2. The warnings on position  2 were fixed by removing white spaces from comments. 
3. The error on position 4 was fixed by removing the end section tag, which was not on the scope.


![html testing img](assets/images/readme-images/html-testing-2.jpg)

![html testing img](assets/images/readme-images/html-testing-3.jpg)

the two similar errors, which are on the two images on the top, were fixed by removing the target attribute from the images

![html testing img](assets/images/readme-images/html-testing-4.jpg)

The errors on the positions 12, 13 on the image above were caused by placing the attribute required in the label of a form instead of the input tag .the errors were fixed by replacing the attribute required from the label tag to the input tag.

![html testing img](assets/images/readme-images/html-testing-5.jpg)

The error on position 1 on the image above was caused by placing a class margin-top-big defined in style.css  us a value for an id inside section's tag in HTML file. The class was removed and placed inside a div below the section's tag to fix the error.
The errors on positions 2, 3 on the image above were caused by
giving the value of the name to type attributes inside the input tag. To fix these errors, the values of type attributes were changed to text.
The two errors on position 4, 6 and the warning on position 5 on the image above were caused by a similar id value inside the member login button (the modal) and the contact form located on the contact page.

![html testing img](assets/images/readme-images/html-testing-6.jpg)

![html no bugs](assets/images/readme-images/html-test.jpg)


### CSS Testing

The testing was performed on the V3C CSS validator by direct input before deploying to the Gitpages. The image below shows all the bugs found.

![html testing img](assets/images/readme-images/css-testing.jpg)

All the bugs found in the CSS file were caused by improper use of the function repeat() while designing the layout using the CSS grid. The function was written **repeat(Number of row or column, fr)** instead of **repeat(Number of row or column, 1fr)**, but the design worked in the browser. The errors were found during the validation in the V3C validator.  When the correct form of the repeat function was used __repeat(Number of row or column, 1fr)__, the layout of the sections designed in the CSS grid completely changed. The final fix for the issue was the use auto **(repeat(Number of row or column, auto)** instead of fractional unit.
