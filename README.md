![html testing img](assets/images/readme-images/html-testing-4.jpg)

![html testing img](assets/images/readme-images/html-testing-5.jpg)

### CSS Testing

The testing was performed on the V3C CSS validator by direct input before deploying to the Gitpages. The image below shows all the bugs found.

![html testing img](assets/images/readme-images/css-testing.jpg)

All the bugs found in the CSS file were caused by improper use of the function repeat() while designing the layout using the CSS grid. The function was written repeat(Number of row or column, fr) instead of repeat(Number of row or column, 1fr), but the design worked in the browser. The errors were found during the validation in the V3C validator.  When the correct form of the repeat function was used (repeat(Number of row or column, 1fr)), the layout of the sections designed in the CSS grid completely changed. The final fix for the issue was using auto (repeat(Number of row or column, auto)) instead of fractional unit.
